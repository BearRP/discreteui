# discreteui
A UI framework for Garry's Mod. Free for public use, just make sure to credit me!

This isn't a stand alone addon, it's made for other developers to use to create their own UI elements. 
Currently, it's in development while I make things for my own server. It's likely going to be updated frequently, and may be
unstable for the time being.

Any addons I make that use it you can be sure will not break with updates (or at least, they'll have an update alongside this addon).
